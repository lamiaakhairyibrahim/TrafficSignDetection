## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project aims to classify traffic signs using machine learning and deep learning techniques.  
The dataset used is [Traffic Sign Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahemateja19bec1025/traffic-sign-dataset-classification/data).  



## ðŸš€ Steps
## preprocessing

  - ### Step 1: Analyze Class Distribution
      - The first step in this project is to analyze the distribution of images across different classes. This helps identify any imbalances in the dataset, which can affect the model's performance
      To achieve this, we:
        Count the number of images per class.
        Visualize the distribution using a bar chart.
        Identify underrepresented and overrepresented classes.
        This analysis guides preprocessing steps such as data augmentation, oversampling, or undersampling to ensure a balancedÂ dataset

## Building a Custom CNN Model
- ### Initial Approach: Training Without Class Balancing

    Before applying any data balancing techniques, we will first train the model on the dataset as it is. This will help us analyze its performance and understand whether class imbalance significantly affects the results.

    - Letâ€™s start by loading the dataset and training a baseline model without any modifications to the classÂ distribution.
 
- Train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch  
- Evaluate the model  

## Using a Pre-trained Model
- Apply transfer learning (ResNet50, EfficientNet, etc.)  
- Compare performance with the custom CNN  

## Object Detection with YOLO
- ##  Convert dataset to YOLO format  
  - 1. Resizing Images:
Resizes all training and testing images to a specified new size and renames them based on their class and original name.
  - 2. Generating YOLO Annotations:
Converts bounding box annotations from CSV files (Train.csv, Test.csv) to YOLO format .txt files, with each label file named similarly to the corresponding image.


      - in the file CSV, I found the (x_mini, x_max, y_mini, y_max), from this, we can find the bounding box of the object in the image.
      - width = x_max - x_mini
      - height = y_max - y_mini
      - x_center = x_mini + ((x_max - x_mini)/2) = (x_max +x_mini)/2
      - y_center = y_mini + ((y_max - y_mini)/2) = (y_max +y_mini)/2
      - and then convert this number into normalized by dividing by width and height, to yolo can able to know the place of the object in the size of the image.
      - width = width/width of image
      - height = height/height of image
      - x_center = x_center / width of image
      - y_center = y_center / hight of imege
      - ### The shape of the file is :
        - class_id x_center y_center width hight 

  - 3. Creating a data.yaml File:
Automatically generates the data.yaml file required by YOLO, including:

        train: path to training images

        val: path to validation images

        nc: number of classes

        names: listÂ ofÂ classÂ names

  - ### Dataset Structure input:

      ```Bash
            dataset/
            |
            |----- Train/
            |   |-------0/
            |   |-------1/
            |   |-------...
            |
            |----- Test/
            |   |----img1
            |   |----img2
            |   |----..
            |
            |----- Train.csv
            |
            |----- Test.csv
      ```
  - Each folder inside Train/ represents a class and contains the corresponding images , and Test/ contains the corresponding images.
  - The CSV files Train.csv and Test.csv contain the bounding box annotationsÂ forÂ eachÂ image.
  - ### Dataset Structure output:
    ``` bash
    dataset/
    â”‚
    â”œâ”€â”€ images/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ train/
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ val/
    â”‚
    â”œâ”€â”€ labels/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ train/
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ val/
    â”‚
    â””â”€â”€Â data.yaml
    ```
  - ### How to use:
  ``` python 
  from your_script_file import bounding

  dataset_path = 'path_to_dataset'
  output_path = 'path_to_output_folder'
  new_size = (width, height)

  bounding(dataset_path, output_path,Â new_size) 
  ```
